# RollingResistance-Simulations
MATLAB simulations of rolling resistance with and without motor for ASME project

# Rolling Resistance Simulations

## Overview
This project simulates rolling resistance for a vehicle model based on ASME-provided files. The goal was to analyze the effect of a motor on rolling resistance.

## My Contribution
- Simulated rolling resistance **with and without the motor**.
- Generated **Velocity vs. Time** and **Rolling Resistance vs. Time** plots.
- Compared the results to identify efficiency differences.

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the `My_Simulations` folder.
3. Run the scripts:
   ```matlab
   run RollingResistance_NoMotor.m
   run RollingResistance_WithMotor.m
